# Elements-Anime
This project is a game based on elements and anime. It was created for the purpose of being a fun activity for CSULB Anime Club during my time there as a cabinet member. Along with a team of friends interested in the development of the game, we present Elements &amp; Anime, written in Lua and using the game engine Love2D.
